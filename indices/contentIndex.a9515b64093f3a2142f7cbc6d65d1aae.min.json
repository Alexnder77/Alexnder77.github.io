Give three advantages of feedback in control.\n  - **Stability**: Feedback control can make a system more stable, preventing it from reacting excessively to disturbances.\n -  **Accuracy**: Feedback systems can correct for disturbances or errors in the system, thereby improving the accuracy of the output.\n -   **Adaptability**: Feedback control systems can adapt to changes in the system's parameters or the environment, maintaining performance despite these changes.\n\n2. Give two disadvantages of feedback in control.\n-   **Complexity**: Feedback control systems can be more complex to design and implement compared to open-loop systems.\n-   **Stability Issues**: While feedback can enhance stability, improper design of the feedback system can also lead to instability.\n\n3. A temperature control system is found to have zero error to a constant tracking input and an error of 0.5°C to a tracking input that is linear in time, rising at the rate of 40°C/ sec. What is the system type of this control system and what is the relevant error constant (Kp or Kv or etc.)?\n\n4. What are the units of Kp, Kv, and Ka?\n-   Kp (Position error constant): unitless, because it multiplies an error measured in the same units as the system output.\n-   Kv (Velocity error constant): s^-1 (per second), as it's the system's gain against a ramp input (rate of change of output).\n-   Ka (Acceleration error constant): s^-2 (per second squared), as it represents the system's gain against a parabolic or acceleration input.\n\n5. What is the definition of system type with respect to reference inputs?\nThe system type with respect to reference inputs is a classification of control systems based on the number of pure integrators in the system's open-loop transfer function. Type 0 systems have no integrators, Type 1 systems have one integrator, Type 2 systems have two, and so on. The system type determines the system's ability to achieve zero steady-state error for various types of reference inputs (step, ramp, etc.).\n\n6. What is the definition of system type with respect to disturbance inputs?\nThe system type with respect to disturbance inputs is similarly based on the number of pure integrators in the system, but it involves the closed-loop transfer function from the disturbance input to the system output. The system's ability to reject disturbance inputs is dependent on this type.\n\n7. Why does system type depend on where the external signal enters the system?\nThe system type depends on where the external signal enters the system because the signal's path through the system determines how many integrations it undergoes before influencing the system output. The control system may handle reference inputs and disturbance inputs differently because they often enter the system at different points, affecting the resultant closed-loop transfer function. For example, a reference input is typically applied at the system's input, while a disturbance might be introduced at various points within the system.\n\n### 4.2\n![[Pasted image 20230604204549.png]]\n\na)\n\t(a) \n\t$$\\frac{Y}{R}=-\\beta_1 K^3 \\Longrightarrow \\beta_1=0.01 $$\n\t(b) \n\t$$ \\frac{Y}{R}=\\left(\\frac{-K}{1+\\beta_2 K}\\right)^3 \\Longrightarrow \\beta_2=0.364 $$\n\t(c) \n\t$$ \\frac{Y}{R}=\\frac{-K^3}{1+\\beta_3 K^3} \\Longrightarrow \\beta_3=0.099$$\n\t\n\n\nb) Sensitivity $S_K^G, \\quad G=\\frac{Y}{R}$\n\t(a)\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{d G}{d K}=-3 \\beta_1 K^2 \\\\\n\\mathcal{S}_K^G=\\frac{K}{G} \\frac{d G}{d K}=\\frac{K}{-\\beta_1 K^3}\\left(-3 \\beta_1 K^2\\right)=3\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n\t(b)\n\t$$ S_K^G=0.646 $$\n\n\t(c) \n \t$$S_K^G=0.03$$\n\t\n\nCase $c$ is the least sensitive.\n\nc) Sensitivities w.r.t. feedback gains:\n\n(b)\n$$\n\\mathcal{S}_{\\beta_2}^G=-2.354\n$$\n\n(c)\n$$\n\\mathcal{S}_{\\beta_3}^G=-0.99\n$$\n\n### 4.22\n![[Pasted image 20230604204452.png]]\na)\n![[Pasted image 20230604210256.png]]\nb) If $V_a=$ constant the system is in steady state:\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta}=\\frac{b_0}{a_1} V_a=\\frac{200 \\times 100}{65} \\frac{60}{2 \\pi} \\frac{\\mathrm{rad} . s e c^{-1}}{\\mathrm{rpm}}=2938 \\mathrm{rpm}\n$$\n(c)\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\theta}{\\theta_r} \u0026 =\\frac{K b_0}{s^2+s\\left(a_1+T_D K b_0\\right)+K b_0}=\\frac{\\omega_n^2}{s^2+2 \\zeta \\omega_n s+\\omega_n^2} \\\\\n\nM_p=17 \\% \u0026 \\Longrightarrow: \\zeta=0.5 \\quad t_s=0.05 \\text { sec. to } 5 \\%: \\\\\n\u0026 \\Longrightarrow e^{-\\zeta \\omega_n t_s}=0.05 \\Longrightarrow s \\omega_n=60 \\Longrightarrow \\omega_n=120\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Longrightarrow e^{-\\zeta \\omega_n t_2}=0.05 \\Longrightarrow \\varsigma \\omega_n=60 \\Longrightarrow \\omega_n=120\n$$\n\nComparing coefficients:\n$$\nK=72, \\quad T_D=3.8 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\n(d) Steady-state error:\n\n$$\nE(s)=\\theta_r-\\theta=\\frac{s\\left(s+a_1+T_D K b_0\\right)}{s^2+s\\left(a_1+T_D K b_0\\right)+K b_0} \\theta_r\n$$\n\nFor $\\theta_r=\\frac{1}{s}$ :\n\n$$\ne_{s s}=\\lim _{s \\rightarrow 0} s E(s)=0 \\quad(\\text { Type 1) }\n$$\n(e) Response to torque:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{\\theta}{Q_L}=\\frac{c_0}{s^2+s\\left(a_1+T_D K b_0\\right)+K b_0} \\\\\n\\theta_{s o}=\\lim _{s \\rightarrow 0} s \\cdot \\theta(s)=\\lim _{s \\rightarrow 0} s \\frac{c_0}{s^2+\\ldots} \\frac{1}{s}=\\frac{c_0}{K b_0}=\\frac{1}{1440} \\mathrm{rad}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n\n### 4.31\n![[Pasted image 20230604204508.png]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-20T07:42:59.512746046Z","tags":[]},"/control_systems/Control-Systems-Dynamic-Models-lecture-notes":{"title":"Control Systems - Dynamic Models lecture notes","content":"# Control Systems - Dynamic Models lecture notes \n## The Need for Mathematical Models in Control\n-   The system output y is a function of system input u, i.e., y = G(u); the constraining relation G representing the system dynamic characteristics.\n-   The feedback approach corrects the current or next control input based on the current and past measurement of the output.\n-   The overall goal of feedback control is for the output of a process to follow a desired reference input, regardless of any external disturbances and any changes of the process dynamics.\n-   Model-based controller design (MBCD) takes advantage of the prior knowledge on the system/process to be controlled during the design process.\n-   The first step in MBCD is to develop a reasonably accurate mathematical representation (dynamic model, Gm) of the system/process to be controlled; modeling error Δ = Gm − G.\n\n## Typical Usage of Process Models\n-   Simulating/predicting the process output y w.r.t. some given process input u before controller design when a model-based control design algorithm is used.\n-   Designing a controller when a model-based control design algorithm is used.\n-   Simulating/predicting the process output when there is a designed controller attached.\n\n## Two Approaches to Build a Mathematical Model for a System\n-   Derivation from physical laws.\n    -   E.g., Newton equations, KVL, KCL...\n    -   Difficult for complex systems\n    -   Parameter values not always (accurately) available\n    -   Good for getting insights \u0026 determining system orders\n-   System identification from observed system response data.\n    -   Knowledge of exact system physics not always needed\n    -   Can use “black box” input-output model forms, i.e., forms not directly corresponding to the physical structure of the system\n    -   Can accurately estimate parameter values from input-output data\n-   Bottom line: Use the insight from the first approach to determine a “suitable” model form/structure and system order for the second approach.\n-   May need several iterations to obtain an acceptable model.\n\n## A Few Common Physical Systems\n-   Mechanical systems\n-   Electrical circuits\n-   Electromechanical systems\n-   Heat and fluid-flow models\n-   Complex mechanical systems\n\n## Summary: Developing Equations of Motion (EOM) for Rigid Bodies\n1.  Assign variables (e.g., x, θ) both necessary and sufficient to describe an arbitrary position/state of the object.\n2.  Draw a free-body diagram of each component. Indicate all forces acting on each (rigid) body and their reference directions. Also indicate the accelerations of the center of mass with respect to an inertial reference for each body.\n3.  Apply Newton’s law in translation (SF = ma) and/or rotation (SM = Ia) form(s).\n4.  Combine the equations to eliminate internal forces.\n5.  The number of independent equations should equal the number of unknowns.\n6.

For a structural process to be controlled, such as a robot arm, what is the meaning of \"collocated control\"? \"Noncollocated control\"? \nCollocated control: Sensors and actuators at the same position. Noncollocated control: Sensors and actuators at different positions.\n\n4. State Kirchhoff's current law.\nTotal current into a junction equals total current out.\n\n5. State Kirchhoff's voltage Jaw.\nTotal voltage around a loop is zero.\n\n6. When, why, and by whom was the device named an \"operational amplifier\"?\n\n7. What is the major benefit of having zero input current to an operational amplifier?\nZero input current allows for ideal voltage amplification.\n\n(Zero input current means that the input impedance of the operational amplifier is infinitely high, which minimizes the loading effect on the input signal source and ensures accurate signal amplification.)\n\n8. Why is it important to have a small value for the armature resistance Ra of an electric motor?\n\nto minimize power losses and maximize efficiency\n\n9.

Give the relationships for (a) heat flow across a substance, and (b) heat storage in a substance.\na) Fourier's law of heat conduction. It states that the rate of heat flow (Q) through a material is directly proportional to the temperature gradient (∆T) across the material and the cross-sectional area (A)\n\nMathematically:\nQ = -k * A * (∆T/∆x)\n\nb) Heat storage in a material is described by the equation \nQ = mc∆T,  \nQ - the heat energy transferred, \nm - mass \nc - heat capacity,\n∆T  - the change in temperature.\n\n13. Name and give the equations for the three relationships governing fluid flow.\n\n### Prob. 2.5\nFor the car suspension discussed in Example 2.2, plot the position of the car and the wheel after the car hits a “unit bump” (i.e., r is a unit step) using MATLAB. Assume that m1 = 10 kg, m2 = 350 kg, Kw = 500000 N/m, Ks = 10000 N/m. Find the value of b that you would prefer if you were a passenger in the car\n\n\nThe transfer function was given in the example in Eq. (2.12) in the course book:\n![[Pasted image 20230523154007.png]]\n\nusing that and the values above we can generate some plots for different values of b using the following code:\n```\nm1 = 10;\nm2 = 350;\nkw = 500000;\nks = 10000;\nB = [ 1000 2000 3000 4000 ];\nt = 0:0.01:2;\n\nfor i = 1:4\n\tb = B(i);\n\tnum = kw*b/(m1*m2)*[1 ks/b];\n\tden = [1 (b/m1+b/m2) (ks/m1+ks/m2+kw/m1) (kw*b/(m1*m2)) (kw*ks/(m1*m2))];\n\tsys = tf(num,den);\n\ty = step(sys, t);\n\tsubplot(2,2,i);\n\tplot(t, y, ':');\n\tlegend('Wheel');\n\tttl = sprintf('Response with b = %4.1f ',b);\n\ttitle(ttl);\nend\n```\n\n![[Pasted image 20230523153636.png]]\n\nFrom the figures, b =\u0019 3000 would be acceptable. There is a lot of overshoot for lower values, and the system gets fast (and harsh) for larger values.\n\n### Prob. 2.9\nIn many mechanical positioning systems there is flexibility between one part of the system and another.

from EOMs only an approximation of reality\n– can be quite accurate for rigid spacecraft (rigid body)\n– very approximate for chemical processes\n– important and prudent to verify the theoretical model with reality (experiment data) before controller design/implementation\n\nWhen process physics too complicated or poorly understood, experimental data the more reliable information\n\nSystem dynamics can change over time/environment\n– e.g., aircraft dynamics at diff. altitude or speed; circuit eqns. at diff. operating points (temperature/process “corners”), need to retune controller w.r.t. a new model with new experimental data\n\n## Types of experimental data\n**transient response**\n– impulse or step input → impulse or step responses\n– representative of the input signal of many control systems\n– for control design, usually further data processing needed (e.g., fitting to a transfer function)\n– often difficult to collect high S/N signals (esp. when closer to ‘0’ steady states); increasing input mag. easily leads to saturation\n**frequency-response data / Bode plot**\n– obtained directly freq. by freq. (swept sine); freq. resp. design method (ch. 6) can be proceed immediately\n– poles/zeros can be estimated by fitting to transfer functions or straight-line asymptotes (lect. 6)\n– can be quite time consuming, esp. for large-time-constant/long oscillation period systems (e.g., chemical/thermal processes)\n\n**stochastic steady-state information**\n– during sys. operation, e.g., an airplane flying through turbulence\n– inconsistent data quality, tending to be worst when control/sys. output the best (small fluctuation); some or even most of the modes hardly excited\n– during fitting, need to separate contributions of disturbance and control input to the sys. output, difficult for closed-loop operation\n\n**pseudorandom-noise data**\n– pseudorandom signals usually generated by digital computers\n– pseudorandom binary signal (PRBS) alternates between +A and -A randomly with a selected level A, a broadband (white signal) quite suitable for identification\n\n\n## Amplitude/time scaling for numerical accuracy\n• magnitude of variables in a problem can be very different, causing numerical difficulties\n– a serious problem when using analog computers, scaling a routine\n– floating-point numbers in digital computers increase the scale, but do not entirely eliminate the problems (e.g., poles with natural freqs. of very different orders; roots sensitivity to coeffs.)\n\n• amplitude scaling\n– pick appropriate units!!\n– normalized w.r.t the largest expected value(s), such thatthe new variable(s) vary between -1 and 1\n\n• time scaling \n– pick an appropriate unit!!

What is the definition of \"transfer function\"? \nThe transfer function of a system is a mathematical representation, in the frequency domain, that relates the output of a system to its input. \n\n2. What are the properties of systems whose response can be described by transfer functions? \n and . \n\nLinearity - Linear systems obey the principles of superposition and homogeneity. \n\nTime-invariance - implies that the behavior and characteristics of the system do not change over time.\n\n3. What is the Laplace transform of $f(t - \\lambda )$ if the transform of f(t) is F(s)? \n\n(where λ is a positive constant) is e\u003csup\u003e-sλ\u003c/sup\u003eF(s), according to the time-shift property of the Laplace transform.\n\n4. State the Final Value Theorem. \n\nif we have a system with Laplace transform F(s), the final value f(∞) in the time domain is given by $f(∞) = lim[s→0] sF(s)$\n\n5. What is the most common use of the Final Value Theorem in control? \nto predict the steady-state value (the value as time goes to infinity) of a system's response to a step input. This allows engineers to estimate how the system will behave in the long run without having to solve the complete differential equation.\n\n6. Given a second-order transfer function with damping ratio $\\zeta$; and natural frequency $\\omega_n$ , what is the estimate of the step response rise time? What is the estimate of the percent overshoot in the step response? What is the estimate of the settling time? \n\n-   The rise time, $T_r$, approximates how long it takes the system's step response to rise from 10% to 90% of the final value. For an underdamped system (0 \u003c ζ \u003c 1), the rise time $T_r$ is typically approximated as $T_r ≈ 1.8/(ω_n√(1-ζ^2))$.\n-   The percent overshoot, expressed as a percentage, describes how much the peak response exceeds the final steady-state value. For an underdamped system (0 \u003c ζ \u003c 1), the percent overshoot, $M_p$, is typically approximated as $M_p$ ≈ 100 * e^(-πζ/√(1-ζ^2)).\n-   The settling time, Ts, estimates how long it takes the system's step response to stay within a certain error band (usually 2% or 5%) of the final value. For an underdamped system (0 \u003c ζ \u003c 1), the settling time Ts is typically approximated as $T_s ≈ 4.6/(ζω_n)$.\n \n7. What is the most noticeable effect of a zero in the RHP on the step response of the second-order system? \n\nA zero in the right half-plane (RHP) of the complex plane for a second-order system can cause a non-minimum phase behavior, which means it will introduce an initial response in the opposite direction of the final steady-state value. This can lead to an initial \"kick\" in the response.\n\n8. What is the major effect of a zero in the LHP on the second-order step response? \nA zero in the left half-plane (LHP) in a second-order system tends to speed up the system response. It makes the transient response faster, allowing the system to reach its steady-state faster, and reducing the overshoot.\n\n9. What is the main effect of an extra real pole on the second-order step response? \nThe introduction of an extra real pole to a second-order system typically leads to a slower system response. The system becomes a third-order system, and it typically has a slower rise time, increased settling time, and decreased overshoot, compared to the original second-order system.\n\n10. Why is stability an important consideration in control system design? \nStability is a crucial consideration in control system design because it ensures that the system will not respond to inputs or disturbances with unbounded outputs. An unstable system could potentially result in catastrophic failure.\n\n11. What is the main use of Routh's criterion? \nRouth's criterion is a mathematical algorithm that can be used to determine the stability of a linear time-invariant system. It involves constructing the Routh array from the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the system and checking the number of sign changes in the first column. If there are no sign changes, the system is stable.\n\n12. Under what conditions might it be important to know how to estimate a transfer function from experimental data?\nIt's important to know how to estimate a transfer function from experimental data when the system's mathematical model is either not available or too complex. These situations might include system identification tasks, where the dynamics of a system are unknown and need to be determined from measured data, or in cases of complex systems where a simple approximation of the dynamics is sufficient\n\n### 3.23\n![[Pasted image 20230604211413.png]]\n\n(a)\n$$\nv_1(t)=L \\frac{d i}{d t}+R i+\\frac{1}{C} \\int i(t) d t\n$$\n(b)\n$$\nv_2(t)=\\frac{1}{C} \\int i(t) d t\n$$\n(c)\n$$\n\\frac{v_2(s)}{v_1(s)}=\\frac{\\frac{1}{s C}}{s L+R+\\frac{1}{s C}}=\\frac{1}{s^2 L C+s R C+1}\n$$\n(d) For $25 \\%$ overshoot $\\xi \\approx 0.4$,\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0.4 \u0026 \\approx \\zeta=\\frac{R}{2 \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}}} \\\\\nR \u0026 =2 \\zeta \\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}}=2 \\times 0.4 \\sqrt{\\frac{10 \\times 10^{-3}}{4 \\times 10^{-6}}}=40 \\Omega .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n### 3.25\n![[Pasted image 20230604211439.png]]\n![[Pasted image 20230604212106.png]]\n\n$$\n\\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\\frac{100 K}{s^2+(25+a) s+25 a+100 K}=\\frac{100 K}{s^2+2 \\zeta \\omega_n s+\\omega_n^2}\n$$\ngiven information:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nR(s) \u0026 =\\frac{1}{s} \\quad \\text { unit step. } \\\\\nM_p \u0026 \\leq 25 \\%, \\\\\nt_s \u0026 \\leq 0.1 \\mathrm{aec} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSolve for $\\zeta$ :\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nM_p \u0026 =e^{-\\pi \\zeta / \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}, \\\\\n\\zeta \u0026 =\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(\\ln M_p\\right)^2}{\\pi^2+\\left(\\ln M_p\\right)^2}} \\geq 0.4037 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSolve for $\\omega_n$ :\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\u0026 e^{-\\zeta \\omega_n t_z}=0.01 \\quad \\text { For a } 1 \\% \\text { aettling time. } \\\\\n\u0026t_s \\leq \\frac{4.606}{\\zeta \\omega_n}=0.1, \\\\\n\u0026\\Longrightarrow \\omega_n \\approx 114.07 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nNow find $a$ and $K$ :\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n2 \\zeta \\omega_n=(25+a), \\\\\na=2 \\varsigma \\omega_n-25=92.10-25=67.10, \\\\\n\\omega_n^2=(25 a+100 K), \\\\\nK=\\frac{\\omega_n^2-25 a}{100} \\approx 113.34 .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nin matlab: \nStep-response\n![[Pasted image 20230604212609.png]]\n\n### 3.32\n![[Pasted image 20230604211550.png]]\n\n### 3.47\n![[Pasted image 20230604211648.png]]","lastmodified":"2023-07-20T07:42:59.516746299Z","tags":[]},"/control_systems/Frequency-response-method":{"title":"Frequency response method","content":"\n# Frequency response method\n\nprobably the most widely used and the most effective for designing control systems  \n– provide good designs with plant model uncertainty  \n• one of the main reasons to use feedback  \n• motivated robust control theories  \n– ease of integration with experimental information (freq. resp. measurement)  \n• determining/fitting plant poles and zeros (as in root locus) not necessarily needed\n\n## Contents  \n• Frequency Response Fundamentals  \n• Bode Plot Sketching Technique  \n• Nyquist Stability Criterion  \n• Stability Margins  \n• Lead/Lag Compensator Design Techniques\n\n## Frequency Response Fundamentals  \n### Frequency response for LTI systems\n\nFrequency response is the system steady-state (t →$\\infty$) response to a sinusoidal signal\n– Note: if u = 0 for t \u003c 0 and $u = sin(\\omega t)$, then there will be a transient response\n\t• the transient may not settle due to system stability (more later)\n– a common myth is that frequency response does not exist for unstable systems.\n\n• For LTI systems, frequency response is also a sinusoid of the same frequency, with gain/phase of $H(j\\omega)$ (for continuous-time sys.) or $H(e^{j\\omega})$ (for discrete-time sys.)\n\t– freq. resp. measurement plot: plotting the measured/estimated gain |H| and phase $\\angle H$ vs. freq. $\\omega$\n\t– Bode plot: plotting the gain vs. freq. in log-log, and the phase vs. freq. in linear-log scales\n\t\n![[Pasted image 20230604193516.png]]\n\n### Initial response to a sinusoid input\n![[Pasted image 20230604193549.png]]\n![[Pasted image 20230604193603.png]]\n![[Pasted image 20230604193628.png]]\n\n### Bode plot/freq. resp. of a lead compensator\n![[Pasted image 20230604193717.png]]\n\n### Frequency response specifications\n![[Pasted image 20230604193733.png]]\n![[Pasted image 20230604193817.png]]\n\n### Advantages of Bode plots\n- Can design dynamic compensators entirely based on Bode plots\n- Can be measured experimentally (freq. meas. by sweepsine techniques)\n- Taking log for mag. simplifies multiplication to add for systems in series connection (better human perception for synthesis)\n- Taking log for freq. permits a much wider range to be displayed\n- Bode plots can be quickly sketched by hands (as root locus plots) for intuitive analysis and compensator designs\n\n## Bode Plot Sketching \n### Bode plots -

Why did Bode suggest plotting the magnitude of a frequency response on log-log coordinates?\nBecause it simplifies the representation of the frequency response of the systems. (On a log-log plot, multiplicative factors become additive, and exponentials become linear)\n\n2. Define a decibel.\nA decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to express the ratio of two values of a physical quantity, often power or intensity.\n\nIn terms of power the dB scale can be defined as: $dB = 10 log_{10}(P1/P2)$\n\n3. What is the transfer function magnitude if the gain is listed as 14 db?\n\nTo convert from dB to magnitude, we use the following formula:$$\\text{Magnitude} = 10^{\\frac{\\text{dB}}{20}}$$Plugging in the given gain of 14 dB, we get:$$\\text{Magnitude} = 10^{\\frac{14}{20}} \\approx 3.98$$\n4. Define gain crossover.\nGain crossover is a point in a Bode plot where the magnitude plot crosses 0 dB.\n\n5. Define phase crossover.\nPhase crossover is the frequency at which the phase shift is 180 degrees in a Bode plot. It's a critical frequency as it is a precursor to potential instability (as the system will start to feedback positively at this point).\n\n6. Define gain margin, GM.\nGain margin (GM) is a measure of how much change in system gain can be tolerated before the system becomes unstable. It is measured in dB and is calculated at the phase crossover frequency (where phase is 180 degrees).\n\n7. Define phase margin, PM.\nPhase margin (PM) is a measure of how much additional phase lag at the gain crossover frequency can be added to the system before it becomes unstable. It's an important measure of the relative stability of a control system.\n\n8. What Bode plot characteristic is the best indicator of the closed-loop step response overshoot?\n1The best indicator of the closed-loop step response overshoot on a Bode plot is the phase margin. A smaller phase margin typically results in more overshoot.\n\n9. What Bode plot characteristic is the best indicator of the closed-loop step response rise time?\nThe best indicator of the closed-loop step response rise time on a Bode plot is the gain crossover frequency. Higher gain crossover frequency corresponds to lower rise time.\n\n10. What is the principal effect of a lag compensation on Bode plot performance measures?\nLag compensation generally increases the phase margin which improves the stability of a system. However, it reduces the bandwidth of the system which can make the system slower.\n\n11. What is the principal effect of a lead compensation on Bode plot performance measures?\ngenerally increases both phase and gain margins, which improves the stability of the system. It can also increase the bandwidth, which can make the system respond quicker.\n\n12. How do you find the $K_v$ of a Type l system from its Bode plot?\nThe velocity error constant $K_v$ of a Type 1 system from its Bode plot is calculated as the inverse of the magnitude of the system's frequency response as the frequency approaches 0.\n\n13. Why do we need to know beforehand the number of open-loop unstable poles in order to tell stability from the Nyquist plot?\n\nThe number of open-loop unstable poles is needed to tell stability from the Nyquist plot because it is used in the Nyquist Stability Criterion. According to the criterion, if the number of counterclockwise encirclements of the point -1 in the Nyquist plot equals the number of open-loop unstable poles, then the system is stable.\n\n\n14. What is the main advantage in control design of counting the encirclements of $-1/K$ of $D(j\\omega)G(j\\omega)$  rather than of $KD(j\\omega)G(j\\omega)$ rather\nbecause the former is the actual location of the critical point in the Nyquist plot for a closed-loop system with unity feedback. So it directly gives us the information about stability of the closed-loop system.\n\n15. Define a conditionally stable feedback system. How can you identify one on a Bode plot?\nA conditionally stable feedback system is a system that is stable for a certain range of gain values but becomes unstable if the gain exceeds this range. On a Bode plot, this system can be identified by noting the gain margin. If the gain margin is small, or the gain plot intersects the 0 dB line at a frequency where the phase is already -180 degrees or less, then the system is conditionally stable.\n\n16. A certain control system is required to follow sinusoids, which may be any frequency in the range $0 \\leq w_l \\leq$ 450 rad/sec and have amplitudes up to 5 units, with (sinusoidal) steady-state error to be never more than 0.01. Sketch (or describe) the corresponding performance function $W_1(\\omega)$.\nFor a control system required to follow sinusoids in the range $0 \\leq w_l \\leq$ 450 rad/sec with amplitudes up to 5 units, and the steady-state error to be never more than 0.01, the performance function $W_1(\\omega)$ should specify that for frequencies up to 450 rad/sec, the magnitude response of the system should be at least 500 (since 5/0.01 = 500) to ensure that the steady-state error remains below the specified limit. Thus, $W_1(\\omega)$ would be a constant line at 54 dB (since 20log10(500) = 54) for frequencies from 0 to 450 rad/sec on a Bode plot.\n\n### 6.2\n![[Pasted image 20230604194648.png]]\n\n### 6.8\n![[Pasted image 20230604194726.png]]\n\n### 6.18\n![[Pasted image 20230604194807.png]]\n\n### 6.58\n![[Pasted image 20230604194833.png]]\n\n### 6.52\n![[Pasted image 20230604194856.png]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-20T07:42:59.516746299Z","tags":[]},"/control_systems/Future-Directions-in-Control-in-an-Information-Rich-World":{"title":"Future Directions in Control in an Information-Rich World","content":"# Future Directions in Control in an Information-Rich World\nDiscusses the future of control systems in an increasingly information-rich world.

Self preview/review very important.  \n- Main focus is classical (frequency-domain) control  theory which for decades is the foundation of rigorous control engineering education in universities worldwide.\n\n## Course description\n• Control is the action of causing a system variable to approach some desired value.  \n• Control is a fundamental and universal problem-solving approach in not only traditional but also interdisciplinary fields.  \n• A control system, in a very general sense, is a system with an (reference) input that can be applied per the desired value and an output from which how well the system variable matches to the desired value (e.g., errors) can be determined\n\n## Course goals\nBasic:  \n– Awareness of the strength and the importance of control systems, especially the effectiveness of feedback  \n– Ability of deriving dynamic models and simulating dynamic responses  \n– Ability of analyzing and designing feedback controllers for linear SISO systems in the frequency domain using root locus and frequency response techniques\n\nBonus:  \n– Awareness of some advanced control topics (e.g., state-space methods, digital control, and nonlinear systems)  \n– Development of technical writing skills in English\n\n## What is Control Engineering?  \n• “Control is the process of causing a system variable to conform to some desired value, called a reference value .”\n• “A control system is a system in which a desired effect (or objective) is achieved by operating on the various manipulable inputs to the plant until the output, which is a measure of the desired effect, falls within an acceptable range of values.”\n\nA methodology to maintain system functioning and enhance system performance  \n• Any engineering/math. problem associated with constraining or minimizing the difference (error) between desired output (yd) and actual system output (y) w.r.t. some decision (control/input) variable(s) (r or u)  \n– involved with mathematical optimization  \n• e.g. Least-square problems: $min_U ||Y_d−Y||^2$, \nwhere Y=AU: a vector of system output; \nU: a vector of decision (input) variables; \nA: a known system model matrix.  \n– can represent a rocket propulsion problem, or DVD read-head positioning prob., an estimation prob. for wireless communication, or wafer alignment prob., etc.  \n• With this general sense, amazingly, quite many system engineering problems fall within the scope of control engineering!!  \n– e.g. signal processing, communication, circuit/photomask design...  \n– There are always problems/jobs for control engineers to solve/do!!  \n– Very powerful generalization once comprehended\n\nTwo major approaches in control  \n• Feedforward (FF) / open-loop  \n– UFF is not a direct function of system output (y)  \n• Feedback (FB) / closed-loop  \n– UFB is a function of system output (y)  \n• Almost all control textbooks talk only about FB and the associated stability properties. However, both FF and FB should be considered in a complete controller design.  \n– FF is effective if the disturbance can be predicted or measured.  \n• not effective if there is un-measurable disturbances or if the (open-loop  \nunstable) system needs stabilization  \n• can be more effective in performance enhancement (vs. FB closed-loop  \nstability usually a concern/tradeoff)  \n• usually readily solved by mathematical optimization  \n– FB is effective if the disturbance is unpredictable or un-measurable,  \nand for stabilizing (open-loop unstable) systems  \n• FB only: errors have to happen before being corrected!  \n• e.g., driving a car in a very thick fog, or by just looking at the rear mirrors  \n– Try to study/consider both FF and FB in practice!!  \n\nFF/FB  \n• The feedback method corrects the current or next control input based on the current and past measurement of the output.  \n• The feedforward method does not use the output measurement directly. Instead, it predicts the best control input based on some assumptions, e.g. the prior knowledge  \nof reference input and deterministic disturbances.  \n\n![[Pasted image 20230516155256.png]]\n## Elementary Feedback Control Block Diagram\n![[Pasted image 20230516155330.png]]\n\n## Open-loop vs. closed-loop Control\nIn open-loop control, the output of the system is not used to adjust the input. In closed-loop control, the output of the system is used to adjust the input in order to keep the system's output at a desired value.\n\nOpen-loop control is simpler to design and implement than closed-loop control. However, open-loop control is not as accurate as closed-loop control. This is because the output of the system can vary from the desired value due to disturbances.\n\nClosed-loop control is more accurate than open-loop control because the output of the system is constantly being adjusted to keep it at the desired value. However, closed-loop control is more complex to design and implement than open-loop control.\n\nExamples of open-loop control systems:\n-   A thermostat that turns on a heater when the temperature in a room falls below a certain level and turns off the heater when the temperature rises above that level.\n-   A cruise control system that maintains a car's speed at a set level.\n-   A sprinkler system that turns on when the ground moisture level falls below a certain level.\n\nExamples of closed-loop control systems:\n-   A system that controls the speed of a motor by adjusting the amount of current that is flowing through the motor.\n-   A system that controls the position of a robot arm by adjusting the angles of the joints in the arm.\n-   A system that controls the temperature of a chemical reaction by adjusting the amount of heat that is being added to the reaction.\n\nIn general, closed-loop control is preferred over open-loop control because it is more accurate. However, open-loop control may be sufficient in some cases where accuracy is not critical.\n\n## History\n**Classical Control (1940s)**\n-   Started with feedback amplifier design\n-   Used vacuum tubes, operational amplifiers, and high open-loop gains\n-   Based on Laplace transforms in the s-domain\n-   Model uncertainty captured in Bode/frequency response plots (e.g., gain/phase margins)\n-   Can be extended to the z-domain\n-   Uses root locus, lead-lag compensation, Nyquist plot, and Nichols chart\n\n**Modern Control (1960s)**\n-   Used for spacecraft control (rigid body) and MIMO systems\n-   Works well when model uncertainty is negligible\n-   Uses state-space, pole placement, and linear-quadratic optimal control\n\n**Post-Modern or Contemporary Control (1980s-Present)**\n-   Used for flexible structures (e.g., hard/optical disk drives, piezo-actuators)\n-   Extends state-space approach to handle model uncertainties\n-   Utilizes advanced optimization techniques to directly solve controller parameters\n-   Uses robust control (H∞, L1, μ-synthesis/DKIT), multi-objective synthesis (mixed H2/H∞, DQIT), and other methods\n\n## HW 1 \n### Review questions\n**1.

Describe three different techniques for measuring temperature.**\n\n1.  **Resistance temperature detector (RTD):** An RTD is a resistor that changes its resistance with temperature.\n2.  **Thermocouple:** A thermocouple is a device that generates an electric current when two different metals are connected and there is a temperature difference between them.\n3.  **Pyrometer:** A pyrometer is a device that measures the infrared radiation emitted by an object to determine its temperature.\n\n**11. Why do most sensors have an electrical output, regardless of the physical nature of the variable being measured?**\n\nMost sensors have an electrical output because it is easy to transmit electrical signals over long distances and to process them electronically.\n\n[FPE] Prob. 1.1 (a)(d) \nDraw a component block diagram for each of the following feedback control systems.  \n(a) The manual steering system of an automobile  \n\n![[The manual steering system of an automobile.excalidraw]]\n\n(d) Watt's steam engine with fly-ball governor\n![[Watt's steam engine.excalidraw]]\n3. [FPE] Prob. 1.8\nFeedback control requires being able to sense the variable being controlled. Because  \nelectrical signals can be transmitted. amplified, and processed easily, often we want to have a sensor whose output is a voltage or current proportional to the variable being measured. Describe a sensor that would give an electrical output proportional to:  \n**(a) pressure**  \nPiezoelectric Pressure Sensor, it consists of a piezoelectric material that generates an electrical charge when pressure is applied. The generated electrical charge or voltage is proportional to the pressure being applied.\n\n**(b) temperature**  \nResistance Temperature Detector - An RTD uses a temperature-sensitive resistor, usually made of platinum, nickel, or copper, whose resistance changes with temperature. The change in resistance is proportional to the change in temperature. By passing a constant current through the resistor and measuring the voltage drop across it, an electrical output proportional to temperature can be obtained.\n\n**(f) linear position**  \nLinear Potentiometer: A linear potentiometer is a variable resistor with a sliding contact that moves along a resistive track. The position of the contact determines the resistance, and an electrical output proportional to position can be obtained by measuring the voltage across the potentiometer when a constant current is applied.\n\n**(g) linear velocity**  \nOptical Encoder: An optical encoder uses a light source, a photodetector, and a slotted or patterned disk to measure linear velocity. As the disk moves, it interrupts the light beam, causing the photodetector to generate an electrical signal proportional to the velocity of the disk.\n\n**(i) translational acceleration**\nCapacitive accelerometer, consists of a fixed plate and a movable plate with a mass attached. As the sensor experiences acceleration, the mass moves, causing a change in capacitance between the plates. This change can be measured as a voltage or current, providing an electrical output proportional to the acceleration.\n\n4. [FPE] Prob. 1.9\nEach of the variables listed in prob. 1.8 can be brought under feedback control.  \nDescribe an actuator that could accept an electrical input and be used to control the  \nvariables listed. Give the unites of the actuator output signal\n\na) Proportional solenoid valve, an actuator that can regulate fluid pressure by adjusting the valve's opening in response to an electrical input signal. The electrical input controls the solenoid's magnetic field strength, which in turn controls the valve position. The actuator output signal is fluid pressure, usually measured in units such as Pascals (Pa) or pounds per square inch (psi).\n\nb) An electric heater with proportional control can accept an electrical input signal to regulate the amount of heat generated. The electrical input controls the power supplied to the heating element, allowing precise temperature control. The actuator output signal is temperature, measured in units such as Celsius (°C)\n\nf) Linear Electric Motor: A linear electric motor is an actuator that converts electrical energy into linear motion. It consists of a stator with coils and a moving part (slider or plunger). The electrical input signal controls the current in the coils, generating a magnetic field that drives the moving part. The actuator output signal is linear displacement, measured in units like millimeters (mm) or inches.\n\ng) A DC motor with a gearbox and a linear drive (such as a lead screw or a belt drive) can be used to control linear velocity. The electrical input signal controls the motor's speed, which is then translated into linear motion through the gearbox and linear drive. The actuator output signal is linear velocity, measured in units like millimeters per second (mm/s) or inches per second (in/s).\n\ni) A voice coil actuator, an actuator that consists of a coil of wire and a magnetic field source, similar to the setup in a loudspeaker. The coil is attached to a mass or movable part, and the electrical input signal controls the current in the coil. This generates a magnetic field that interacts with the field source, producing a force that accelerates the mass. The actuator output signal is translational acceleration, measured in units such as meters per second squared (m/s²) or g (9.81 m/s²).\n\n5.

Give two definitions for the root locus.\na) The root locus is a graphical representation of the possible locations of the closed-loop poles of a system as a parameter (often the gain) is varied.\n\nb) The root locus is a plot showing the paths of the poles of a transfer function in the complex plane as a parameter changes, typically the gain.\n\n2. Define the negative root locus.\nThe negative root locus refers to the portion of the root locus that lies on the left-hand side of the complex plane (negative real axis).\n\n3. Where are the sections of the (positive) root locus on the real axis?\nThe sections of the positive root locus on the real axis are located to the left of an odd number of real-axis finite poles and zeros.\n\n4. What are the angles of departure from two coincident poles at s = -a on the real axis? There are no poles or zeros to the right of -a.\nThe angles of departure from two coincident poles at s = -a on the real axis are 180 degrees or π radians.\n\n5. What are the angles of departure from three coincident poles at s = -a on the real axis? There are no poles or zeros to the right of s = -a.\nThe angles of departure from three coincident poles at s = -a on the real axis are 120 degrees or 2π/3 radians, 240 degrees or 4π/3 radians, and 360 degrees or 2π radians.\n\n6. What is the principal effect of a lead compensation on a root locus?\nto shift the root locus towards the left-hand side of the complex plane, thus improving the stability of the system. Lead compensation can help to increase the phase margin and reduce the settling time.\n\n7. What is the principal effect of a lag compensation on the steady-state error to a polynomial reference input?\nThe principal effect of a lag compensation on the steady-state error to a polynomial reference input is to decrease the steady-state error. Lag compensation increases the low-frequency gain of the system, improving the tracking of the reference input signal.\n\n8. What is the principal effect of a lag compensation on a root locus in the vicinity of the dominant closed-loop roots?\nThe principal effect of a lag compensation on a root locus in the vicinity of the dominant closed-loop roots is to pull the root locus closer to the original dominant poles. This effect increases the damping and stability of the system.\n\n9. Why is the angle of departure from a pole near the imaginary axis especially important?\nThe angle of departure from a pole near the imaginary axis is particularly important because it determines the direction in which the root locus branches towards the complex plane. It influences the stability and dynamic response of the system. A small change in the angle of departure can lead to significant changes in the closed-loop behavior.\n\n10. Define a conditionally stable system.\nA conditionally stable system is a system that can be stable or unstable depending on certain conditions. It means that the system may exhibit stable behavior within a specific range of parameters, but outside that range, it becomes unstable.\n\n11. Show, with a root-locus argument, that a system having three poles at the origin MUST be conditionally stable\nA system having three poles at the origin (s = 0) must be conditionally stable. To show this using a root-locus argument, we consider a system with three poles at the origin. Since the poles are at the origin, the system is open-loop unstable. As we increase the gain, the root locus will move away from the poles at the origin, but it will always approach the poles at the origin. Therefore, the system cannot become stable regardless of the gain value, indicating that it is conditionally stable.\n\n### 5.14 \n![[Pasted image 20230523200137.png]]\n\nThe characteristic equation: \n$$L(s) = \\frac{10s}{s^2 + s+ 10}$$\n```\nnum = [10 0];\nden = [1 1 10];\nL = tf(num, den);\n\ndesired_damping_ratio = 0.6;\n\n% Calculate the poles and zeros of the transfer function\n[num_roots, den_roots] = tfdata(L, 'v');\npoles = roots(den_roots);\n\n% Calculate the desired pole location based on the damping ratio\n\ndesired_pole = -desired_damping_ratio * real(poles(1));\n\n% Calculate the gain for the desired pole location\n\ndesired_gain = abs(polyval(num_roots, desired_pole) / polyval(den_roots, desired_pole));\n\ndisp(['The desired root locus point with 0.6 damping: ', num2str(desired_pole)]);\n\ndisp(['The corresponding gain (k): ', num2str(desired_gain)]);\n```\n\nthis returned: \nk: 0.28874\n\n![[Pasted image 20230523203432.png|200]]\n\n### 5.20\n![[Pasted image 20230523200340.png]]\n\nplots:  (a and b are reversed)\n![[Pasted image 20230523203936.png]]\n\n### 5.27 #TODO\n![[Pasted image 20230523200406.png]]\n\n### 5.33\n![[Pasted image 20230523200450.png]]\n(a) The locus in this case is the imaginary axis and cannot meet the specs for any K\n(b) The specs require that $\\zeta\u003e0.6, \\omega_n\u003e18$. \nstart with  $z=15$  - \u003e The locus will be a circle with radius 15\n\nBecause of the zero, the overshoot will be increased and plot indicates that we'd better make the damping greater than 0.7. \nwe can lower the overshoot by setting the zero at a low value and putting the poles on the real axis.

Why is it convenient to write equations of motion in state-variable form? \n\tIt is convenient to write equations of motion in state-variable form because it provides a compact and systematic representation of a dynamic system. By representing the system in terms of state variables, we can describe its behavior using a set of first-order differential equations. This allows for easier analysis, modeling, and control design, as it separates the system dynamics from the input and output.\n\n2. Give an expression for the transfer function of this system. \nThe transfer function of the system can be expressed as $H(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D$ where A, B, C, and D are matrices representing the system dynamics and input-output relationships.\n\n3. Give two expressions for the poles of the transfer function of the system. \n\t1) The poles of the transfer function correspond to the eigenvalues of matrix A in the state-space representation. \n\t2) The poles can also be obtained by finding the roots of the characteristic equation det(sI - A) = 0, where I is the identity matrix.\n\n4. Give an expression for the zeros of the system transfer function. \nThe zeros of the system transfer function can be obtained by solving the equation H(s) = 0, where H(s) is the transfer function.\n\n5. Under what conditions will the system be observable from the output y? \nThe system will be observable from the output y if and only if the observability matrix $[C, CA, CA^2, ..., CA^{(n-1)}]$ has full rank, where n is the dimension of the state vector x.\n\n6. Under what condition will the state of the system be controllable? \nThe state of the system will be controllable if and only if the controllability matrix [B, AB, A^2B, ..., A^(n-1)B] has full rank.\n\n7. Give an expression for the closed-loop poles if state feedback of the form u = −Kx is used. \nIf state feedback of the form u = -Kx is used, the closed-loop poles can be obtained by evaluating the eigenvalues of the matrix A - BK, where K is the feedback matrix.\n\n8. Under what conditions can the feedback matrix K be selected so that the roots of $a_c (s) = 0$ are arbitrary? \nThe feedback matrix K can be selected so that the roots of ac(s) = 0 are arbitrary if and only if the pair (A, B) is controllable.\n\n9. What is the advantage of using the LQR or SRL in designing the feedback matrix K? \nThe advantage of using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) or Systematic Robust Control (SRL) in designing the feedback matrix K is that they provide systematic methods for optimizing the control performance. These techniques consider the system dynamics, cost criteria, and possible uncertainties to determine the optimal feedback gains, resulting in improved control performance, stability, and robustness.\n\n10. What is the main reason for using an estimator in feedback control?\nThe main reason for using an estimator (such as a state observer or Kalman filter) in feedback control is to estimate the system's unmeasured states. In many practical scenarios, not all states of the system are directly measurable. By using an estimator, we can obtain an estimate of the unmeasured states based on the available measurements. This estimated state information can then be used for feedback control, enabling the control system to operate based on a more complete understanding of the system's dynamics.\n\n### 7.3\n![[Pasted image 20230523162549.png]]\nall of them can be calculated with matlab using the tf2ss comand\n\na) F = -0.1000; G = 1; H = 0.1000; J = 0\nb) F = 10; G = 1; H = 200; J = 25:\n\nc)\n![[Pasted image 20230523162943.png]]![[Pasted image 20230523162832.png|150]]\n\nd) ![[Pasted image 20230523163057.png|150]]\ne) ![[Pasted image 20230523163241.png]]\n\n### 7.15\n![[Pasted image 20230523163314.png]]\n\nWe are given $\\dot{x} = Fx + Gu$.

The report begins by defining control technology as \"the use of sensors, actuators, and algorithms to regulate the behavior of physical systems.\" The report then goes on to discuss the history of control technology, its current state, and its future potential.\n\nThe report argues that control technology has had a profound impact on society and the economy. For example, control technology has been used to improve the efficiency of factories, power plants, and other industrial facilities. Control technology has also been used to develop new products and services, such as self-driving cars and medical devices.\n\nThe report concludes by discussing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for control technology. The report argues that control technology will continue to play an increasingly important role in society and the economy. However, the report also warns that the development and use of control technology must be carefully managed in order to avoid negative consequences.\n\nkey take aways: \n-   Control technology has had a profound impact on society and the economy.\n-   Control technology has been used to improve the efficiency of factories, power plants, and other industrial facilities.\n-   Control technology has also been used to develop new products and services, such as self-driving cars and medical devices.\n-   Control technology will continue to play an increasingly important role in society and the economy.\n-   The development and use of control technology must be carefully managed in order to avoid negative consequences.\n\n\n**History of control technology**\n\nThe history of control technology can be traced back to the early 1700s, when James Watt invented the centrifugal governor. The centrifugal governor is a simple device that uses the force of gravity to regulate the speed of a steam engine. The governor consists of two weighted arms that are connected to a shaft. As the engine speed increases, the weighted arms move outward, which causes the shaft to slow down. As the engine speed decreases, the weighted arms move inward, which causes the shaft to speed up.\n\nThe centrifugal governor was a major breakthrough in the development of control technology. It allowed for the first time to automatically regulate the speed of a machine. This led to a number of improvements in manufacturing, including the development of more efficient steam engines and the ability to produce more complex products.\n\n**Current state of control technology**\n\nIn the 20th century, control technology saw rapid development due to advances in electronics and computing. This led to the development of more sophisticated control systems that could be used to regulate a wider range of physical systems.\n\nOne of the most important developments in control technology was the advent of digital control. Digital control systems use computers to process information and make decisions about how to regulate a system. This allows for much more precise control than was possible with analog control systems.\n\nDigital control systems are now used in a wide range of applications, including manufacturing, power generation, transportation, and medical devices. They have helped to improve efficiency, safety, and reliability in these industries.\n\n**Future potential of control technology**\n\nThe future of control technology is very promising. Advances in sensors, actuators, and computing are making it possible to develop even more sophisticated control systems. These systems will be able to regulate a wider range of physical systems with greater precision and efficiency.\n\nControl technology is also being used to develop new products and services. For example, self-driving cars use control technology to navigate roads and avoid obstacles. Medical devices such as pacemakers and insulin pumps use control technology to regulate the body's functions.\n\nThe development of control technology is having a major impact on society and the economy. It is helping to improve efficiency, safety, and reliability in a wide range of industries. It is also being used to develop new products and services that are improving the quality of life.\n\n**Challenges and opportunities**\n\nThe development and use of control technology also presents some challenges. One challenge is the potential for security vulnerabilities. Control systems are often connected to networks, which makes them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Another challenge is the potential for unintended consequences. Control systems can have a significant impact on the physical world, so it is important to carefully consider the potential consequences of their use.\n\nDespite these challenges, the future of control technology is very promising. It has the potential to improve the quality of life for people all over the world.","lastmodified":"2023-07-20T07:42:59.516746299Z","tags":[]},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (测试)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\n几乎在我们意识到之前，我们已经离开了地面。\n\n우리가 그것을 알기도 전에 우리는 땅을 떠났습니다.\n\n私たちがそれを知るほぼ前に、私たちは地面を離れていました。\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-20T07:42:59.516746299Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**!

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere\n2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations\n3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-20T07:42:59.520746553Z","tags":[]},"/notes/preview-changes":{"title":"Preview Changes","content":"\nIf you'd like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, the following\ninstructions guide you through installing the proper dependencies to run it locally.\n\n\n## Install `hugo-obsidian`\nThis step will generate the list of backlinks for Hugo to parse. Ensure you have [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (\u003e= 1.16) installed.\n\n```bash\n# Install and link `hugo-obsidian` locally\ngo install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian@latest\n```\n\nIf you are running into an error saying that `command not found: hugo-obsidian`, make sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly (see [[notes/troubleshooting#`command not found: hugo-obsidian`|the troubleshooting page]])! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize hugo-obsidian as an executable.\n\n##  Installing Hugo\nHugo is the static site generator that powers Quartz. [Install Hugo with \"extended\" Sass/SCSS version](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) first. Then,\n\n```bash\n# Navigate to your local Quartz folder\ncd \u003clocation-of-your-local-quartz\u003e\n\n# Start local server\nmake serve\n\n# View your site in a browser at http://localhost:1313/\n```\n\n\u003e [!INFO] Docker Support\n\u003e\n\u003e If you have the Docker CLI installed already, you can avoid installing `hugo-obsidian` and `hugo`. Instead, open your terminal, navigate to your folder with Quartz and run `make docker`\n\nAfterwards, start the Hugo server as shown above and your local backlinks and interactive graph should be populated!

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://beta.operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true`, `operandApiKey` to your copied key, and `operandIndexId` to the ID of the index we created from earlier..\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nsearch:\n  enableSemanticSearch: true\n  operandApiKey: \"jp9k5hudse2a828z98kxd6z3payi8u90rnjf\"\n  operandIndexId: \"s0kf3bd6tldw\"\n```\n7. Push your changes to the site and wait for it to deploy.\n8. Check the Operand dashboard and wait for your site to index.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-20T07:42:59.520746553Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
