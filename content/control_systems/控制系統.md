# 控制系統 Control systems 

My notes and solutions to the 控制系統 Control systems lectures: 

**Course outline**
1.   Overview and history of control 
[[Overview and History of Control]]

[[Future Directions in Control in an Information-Rich World]]
[[The Impact of Control Technology (IoCT) summary]]

2. Dynamic Models
[[Control Systems - Dynamic Models lecture notes]]

3. Dynamic Responses
[[Dynamic Response]] - Relating time-responses and stability to pole locations on the s-plane

4. Basic Properties of Feedback
[[Basic Properties of Feedback]] - How feedback improves steady-states errors and sensitivity

5. Root Locus Techniques
[[Root Locus Techniques]]
How changes of a system parameter (e.g., feedback gain) modify the pole locations
– without solving polynomial roots directly
– the technique is called root-locus method
– can be utilized to design compensator parameters

6. Frequency Response Methods
[[Frequency response method]]

7. State-Space Methods
[[State-Space Methods]]

8. Symmetric Root Locus Technique
[[Multivariable Optimal Control]]
