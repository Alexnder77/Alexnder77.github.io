On this site I show some of the projects I've been working on as well as some notes and ideas about topics I am exploring. This digital space serves as both a portfolio of my projects for potential future employers and a platform to share my thoughts and ideas with the world. 

## About me 
Industrial engineering student specializing in computer science, also a minor in Chinese. fascinated by AI and machine learning, recently exploring topics related to data science and data engineering. 

**Interests**: 
- Computer Science 
- Data science & AI
- Language learning (Mandarin Chinese)
- Learning in general (SRS, Memory palace, ...)


## Site Overview
This site is divided into 3 parts: 

- **Projects**
This space showcases the coding projects that I have passionately undertaken. Each project represents a challenge I embraced to apply the theories I've acquired.

- **Articles**
My collection of articles provides a window into my exploration of various subjects. Expect insights into tech trends, tutorials, and reflections on the ever-evolving tech landscape.

- **Notes/digital garden (Work in progress)** 
The idea of this is to be able to share some of my notes on different topics, in what is known as a "digital garden" 
inspired from the concept of [Andy Matuschak's evergreen notes](https://andymatuschak.org/evergreen/).
This is still a work in progress.
